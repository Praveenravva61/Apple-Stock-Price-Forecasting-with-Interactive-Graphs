# Apple Stock Price Forecasting with Interactive Graphs

This project focuses on forecasting Apple Inc.'s stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques and visualizing the predictions through interactive graphs. The analysis incorporates historical stock price data and implements features like candlestick charts, moving averages, and forecasting accuracy metrics to provide meaningful insights.

## 🔥 Features

- **Stock Price Forecasting**: Uses machine learning models like LSTM to predict future prices.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Dynamic candlestick charts with moving averages and volume data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Incorporates RMSE and other key metrics for model performance evaluation.
- **Data Analysis**: Visualizes trends and patterns in historical stock data.
